                            <p>Representing the southern region of the country, we have arroz carreteiro, typical of Rio
                                Grande do Sul.
                                The dish came about when the carreteiros (cargo carriers) who traveled in carts pulled
                                by
                                oxen
                                pulled by oxen cooked a mixture of rice and sun-dried meat stew in an iron pot.
                                meat stew.
                                As it was a practical recipe, it was easily prepared by a lone traveler.
                                The dish was incorporated into Brazilian cuisine and today it is quite common to find
                                and
                                in all regions of the country.

                            <p>Acarajé is a delicious delicacy prepared with a handmade bean cake,
                                seasoned with onion and salt, fried in palm oil and then filled with vatapá (coconut
                                milk,
                                cashew nuts, peanuts and shrimp), vinaigrette and dried shrimp.
                                Incidentally, if someone asks you if you want your acarajé cold or hot, they are not
                                referring to the temperature at which it is served.
                                the temperature at which it is served, but rather the amount of chili pepper you add!

                            <p>During the expeditions of the 17th century, in colonial Brazil, foods such as corn flour,
                                beans, bacon and dried meat were packed together and rattled along the way,
                                getting turned over. Thus, virado à paulista was born
                                Over the years, the recipe gained new ingredients, such as pork, fried egg,
                                rice, sausage, cabbage, pork rinds and plantains.
